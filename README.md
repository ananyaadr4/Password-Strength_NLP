Password Strength

 - Analyzed and improved password strength using entropy calculations and machine learning models.
 -  Collected and analyzed 5,000 password samples for a comprehensive strength assessment.
 -Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data manipulation and model development.
 -Achieved 88% accuracy in classifying password strength
 -Discovered 30% of passwords were vulnerable due to low entropy; implemented strategies improved average password strength by 20%.
