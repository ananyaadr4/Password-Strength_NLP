Password Strength
Analyzed and improved password strength using entropy calculations and machine learning models.
-Collected and analyzed 5,000 password samples for a comprehensive strength assessment.
-Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for data manipulation and model development.
-Achieved 88% accuracy in classifying password strength
-Discovered 30% of passwords were vulnerable due to low entropy; implemented strategies improved average password strength by 20%.
